Our repository's goal is to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, we looked at multiple metrics involving the average age that people die in each neighborhood, {insert your metric here}, and {insert your metric here}.

## Data Sets Used:
**Average (Median) Age at Death: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/median-age-death/resource/c2e1500a-a12a-4e91-be94-76c6a892b7e2**

*This dataset specifically looks at the average age (using the median) that people die in each neighborhood. It separates the deaths by race; however, in this project, I only looked at the total deaths.*

**School District Blood Lead Level Test Results: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-elevated-blood-lead-level-rates/resource/e99fa58e-f09a-4aa0-90a9-7996a0bca147?view_id=6306bb29-c67f-4a79-8247-fb02b5207876**

*This data set described the level of lead, in percentage, of each school district over the span of 5 years. I decided to find the highest percentage and then find the neighborhood located in that specified school district.*
