Our repository's goal is to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, we looked at multiple metrics involving the average age that people die in each neighborhood, {insert your metric here}, and {insert your metric here}.

## Data Sets Used:
**Average (Median) Age at Death: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/median-age-death/resource/c2e1500a-a12a-4e91-be94-76c6a892b7e2**
*This dataset specifically looks at the average age (using the median) that people die in each neighborhood. It separates the deaths by race; however, in this project, I only looked at the total deaths.*
